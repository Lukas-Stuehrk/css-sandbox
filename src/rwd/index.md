Currently `@media` queries give us a way to adjust a design
based on device features, user-preferences, and viewport size.
But modern web development relies heavily on modular
"blocks" and "components"
that can be moved around.

Authors want a way to style these components
based on more immediate context --
like the width of a parent container --
which might not match cleanly to viewport media.

Grid and flexbox both provide some tools
for managing available space,
so in addition to "container query" solutions,
I also want to think about if/where they can also be improved
for responsive design.

## Existing Solutions

[_Who is Working on Container Queries_](http://whoisworkingoncontainerqueries.com/)
contains a long list of existing JS plugins.

There are also some interesting CSS custom-property solutions.
These all work one-property-at-a-time,
much like the [`switch()` proposal](switch/)…

## My Notes

These different directions are not exclusive --
a full solution for styling responsive components
will likely require multiple approaches.
