## Implementations:

- [Chromium](https://crbug.com/1145970) --
  in Chrome Canary, go to `chrome://flags` & "Enable CSS Container Queries"
  (This is a draft prototype and may not match the final design)

## Polyfills:

It's likely that no polyfill can perfectly emulate
the feature as specified,
but hopefully we can handle the most common use-cases.

- [CQFill](https://github.com/jsxtools/cqfill)
  by **Jonathant Neal** --
  still a very early prototype/proof-of-concept,
  requiring both pre-processor compilation (available for PostCSS)
  and run-time JS (using ResizeObserver).
