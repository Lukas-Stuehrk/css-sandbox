As part of my work on Container Queries,
I've been taking a broad look
at the state of "responsive components" --
especially in relation to grid & flex layouts.
Are there ways we can improve the tools we have,
to help address the goal of "container queries"
inside the layout tools themselves?

Auto-fit and auto-fill grids
can be particularly helpful for
adjusting grid layouts to fit available space --
but they come with several limitations.

This is a collection of potential improvements,
linked to Github issues where appropriate.

## Responsive track spanning

Some of the most common grid issues
stem from the difficulty of placing items
in relation to implicit or auto-fit/auto-fill grids.
There are several useful ideas here:

We often want to span
multiple columns/rows
_only when they are available_
in the explicit, auto-generated grid.
That would require the
[ability to clamp track spanning (#5852)](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/5852)
with a syntax like the proposed
`span-minmax(1, 3)`.

When mixing explicit & implicit grids,
it would be useful to align with
(span from or too)
the first or last line --
which could be explicit (`1`/`-1`),
but might also be implicit.
That is discussed some in
[span to last track... (#2402)](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/2402).

That problem gets even larger
when you consider aligning the `-end` value,
while maintaining auto-placement for the `-start` value.
All of these issues are addressed together,
with an initial prototype,
by
[indefinite spans (#388)](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/388).

I'm very excited about this area of exploration.

## Styling grid abstractions

There have been many requests to style
the individual grid cells/tracks/areas,
as well as the gaps between them.

### Grid/flex/multi-column gap-rules

Fantasai opened a large thread
to discuss the
[styling gaps/gutters (#2748)](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/2748) --
using or building on `column-rule`.
This approach would ideally be generic,
applying to grid, flexbox, and multi-column layouts.
(This was discussed by the Working Group in May 2020,
with a request for more "white-boarding" of options)

### Grid cells, tracks, and areas

There are multiple issues
related to styling cells, tracks, and areas.
This can take various forms,
and overlap with a number of other issues.
One idea is to select grid-items
based on their auto-placement (track or cell) --
see [target items in nth-row of implicit grid (#1943)](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/1943) --
but that might cause recursion issues.

More directions
are explored in the issue thread for
[decorative grid-cell pseudo-elements (#499)](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/499).

Jen Simmons has
proposed an `@region` rule,
with named areas:

```css
@region #grid foobar {
  grid: 3 / 1 / 4 / 2;
}
foobar {
  background: yellow;
}
```

That seems over-complicated
for the use-case of styling tracks/areas in the abstract,
but she [expands on it to solve some related issues](https://speakerdeck.com/jensimmons/proposal-to-csswg-sept-2016?slide=47).

==@@@ link to other region-like issues==

For the simpler use-case of decorative styling
on cells/tracks/areas,
I like Tab Atkins proposal
of a `::grid-area()` pseudo-element:

```css
#grid::grid-area(1 / 2 / 3 / 4) {
  background-color: red; /* etc */
  /* grid-positioning properties are blacklisted */
}
```

But it does raise a few questions for me:
- How do overlapping area styles "stack" on a z-index?
- Do we really need to define the area in the pseudo-element function?

## Managing grid flow and areas

==@@@ Flesh out the rest of these==

- Default Grid Columns, Rows, and Areas #4002
- Add a flex/grid-clear property #3974
- Auto-placement aligning to a named line #796 (âœ… css-grid-3)
- 'auto' keyword should work with name grid lines/areas #3243
- Flow multiple elements together into same grid area #1183
- Allow auto-placement to use areas #4457
- [Grid area as element (#4416)](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/4416)
- Automatically span rows and columns based on content size #1373

## Defining Grids

- Overlapping cells in grid-template-areas syntax #2808
- Aspect ratio units needed #1173
- Repeating named grid areas #3242
- Specify an optional sequence of track sizes #3328
- Set adjusted-to-fit repeated track sizes #3767

## Sub-grid improvements

- Ability to name grids and reference them from subgrids #1375

## Improving grid gaps

- Collapse grid-gap when item is hidden. #5813
- Control size of individual gutters independently #1659

## Notes

- Fit/fill require all columns to be identical
- There is no way to span "extra" gutters adjacent to a space
